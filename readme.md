#### narrative

I have no idea how I ended up [here](http://www.dea.gov/clan-lab/clan-lab.shtml). 

#### examples 

A few exploratory spatial data anaylsis plots drafted - just for a quick sense of things to do with the the data. Legends and text were quickly added later in InDesign.

![Arizona Coordinates](http://pi.mozzarella.website/DEA-EDA/pages/AZ-H.jpg "Arizona Coordinates")

![AZ-Phoenix Coordinates](http://pi.mozzarella.website/DEA-EDA/pages/AZ-PHX.jpg "Phoenix Coordinates")

Arizona clan-lab coordinates mapped with natural resource and water boundaries. The black solid- and red dashed- lines represent the Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram of the coordinates, respectively. The most dense cluster forms around the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. 

![Metropolitan Florida](http://pi.mozzarella.website/DEA-EDA/pages/FL.jpg)

The Tampa and Orlando metropolitan areas of Florida, mapped on black as a test. The opacity of the points is set to 42% when plotted - a very loose, approximate representation of density of laboratories.
